<!-- Step 1
HTML elements have opening tags like <h1> and closing tags like </h1>.

The text for an element goes between its opening and closing tags.

Find the h1 element and change its text to: -->

<h1>CatPhotoApp</h1>

<!-- Step 2
The h1 through h6 heading elements are used to signify the importance of content below them. The lower the number, the higher the importance, so h2 elements have less importance than h1 elements. Only use one h1 element per page and place lower importance headings below higher importance headings.

Below the h1 element, add an h2 element with this text: -->

<h1>CatPhotoApp</h1>
<h2>Cat Photos</h2>

<!-- Step 3
The p element is used to create a paragraph of text on websites. Create a p element below your h2 element and give it the following text:

Click here to view more cat photos. -->

<h2>Cat Photos</h2>
<p>Click here to view more cat photos.</p>

<!-- Step 4
Commenting allows you to leave messages without affecting the browser display. It also allows you to make code inactive. A comment in HTML starts with contains any number of lines of text, and ends with 
Add a comment above the p element with this text: -->

<!-- TODO: Add link to cat photos -->
<p>Click here to view more cat photos.</p>

<!-- Step 5
HTML5 has some elements that identify different content areas. These elements make your HTML easier to read and help with Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and accessibility.

Identify the main section of this page by adding a <main> opening tag after the h1 element, and a </main> closing tag after the p element. -->

<h1>CatPhotoApp</h1>
<main>
  <h2>Cat Photos</h2>
  <!-- TODO: Add link to cat photos -->
  <p>Click here to view more cat photos.</p>
</main>

<!-- Step 21
Use list item (li) elements to create items in a list. Here is an example of list items in an unordered list:

<ul>
  <li>milk</li>
  <li>cheese</li>
</ul>
Within the ul element nest three list items to display three things cats love: -->

<ul>
  <li> cat nip </li>
  <li> laser pointers </li>
  <li> lasagna </li>
</ul>

<!-- Step 22
After the unordered list, add a new image with an src attribute value set to:

https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/lasagna.jpg

And its alt attribute value to:

A slice of lasagna on a plate. -->

<ul>
  <li>cat nip</li>
  <li>laser pointers</li>
  <li>lasagna</li>
</ul>
<img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/lasagna.jpg" alt="A slice of lasagna on a plate."/>

<!-- Step 23
The figure element represents self-contained content and will allow you to associate an image with a caption.

Nest the image you just added within a figure element. -->
<figure>
  <img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/lasagna.jpg" alt="A slice of lasagna on a plate.">
</figure>

<!-- Step 24
A figure caption (figcaption) element is used to add a caption to describe the image contained within the figure element. For example, <figcaption>A cute cat</figcaption> adds the caption A cute cat.

After the image nested in the figure element, add a figcaption element with text set to:

Cats love lasagna. -->
<figure>
  <img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/lasagna.jpg" alt="A slice of lasagna on a plate.">
  <figcaption> Cats love lasagna. </figcaption>
</figure>

<!-- Step 25
Emphasize the word love in the figcaption element by wrapping it in an emphasis em element. -->

<figcaption>Cats <em>love</em> lasagna.</figcaption>

<!-- Step 26
After the figure element, add another h3 element with the text:

Top 3 things cats hate: -->

<figure>
  <img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/lasagna.jpg" alt="A slice of lasagna on a plate.">
  <figcaption>Cats <em>love</em> lasagna.</figcaption>  
</figure>
<h3>Top 3 things cats hate:</h3>

<!-- Step 27
The code for an ordered list (ol) is similar to an unordered list, but list items in an ordered list are numbered when displayed.
After the second section element's last h3 element, add an ordered list with these three list items:
flea treatment thunder other cats -->

<h3>Top 3 things cats hate:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>flea treatment</li>
  <li>thunder</li>
  <li>other cats</li>
</ol>

<!-- Step 28
After the ordered list, add another figure element. -->

<ol>
  <li>flea treatment</li>
  <li>thunder</li>
  <li>other cats</li>
</ol>
<figure></figure>

<!-- Step 29
Inside the figure element you just added, nest an img element with a src attribute set to https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/cats.jpg. -->

<figure>
  <img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/cats.jpg"/>
</figure>

<!-- Step 30
To improve accessibility of the image you just added, add an alt attribute with the text:

Five cats looking around a field. -->

<img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/cats.jpg" alt="Five cats looking around a field.">
